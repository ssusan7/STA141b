To support universal health coverage, IHME will generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for a broad set of interventions at national and local levels by extending and improving our meta-regression analysis of published estimates. ICERs are a metric for comparing health interventions, and represent the difference in cost between two possible interventions, divided by the difference in their effect. The meta-regression analysis will account for variation across epidemiological and socioeconomic context, study design and methods, and intervention characteristics.

The main purpose of the Data Analyst position is to provide support to key research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multidisciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts are tasked with developing an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. We are looking for an individual who is able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The role calls for dexterity in working with complex databases, the ability to assess, transform, and control the quality of results, and skill at coding in multiple languages (Python or R) to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers.

Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts and Data Extraction Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

After opening our doors in 2003, we set out to address the challenges that face the independent insurance agent in the P&C industry. How? By listening to agents on a regular basis. We learned the insurance industry was still grappling with the inaccuracies of manufactured rates. To solve this problem we created our flagship product, EZLynx® Rating Engine, and in doing so pioneered the concept of real-time rating. EZLynx® Rating Engine still remains the leading real-time solution vendor for independent agents, with more than half of all agencies relying on us to provide more than 5 million home, auto, and package transactions every month in 48 states with 169 insurance companies.

The good news is that we didn't stop there. We created more solutions that tested the boundaries of technology. With our mission to address industry issues in mind, we set out to fully automate the exchange of information between the insurance carrier, independent agent, and end consumer. Today, EZLynx is much more than just a rating company. It has expanded to include solutions that reach every aspect of agency life, including consumer-facing quoting & self-service, customer life-cycle management and retention, automated marketing, and website solutions."

After opening our doors in 2003, we set out to address the challenges that face the independent insurance agent in the P&C industry. How? By listening to agents on a regular basis. We learned the insurance industry was still grappling with the inaccuracies of manufactured rates. To solve this problem we created our flagship product, EZLynx® Rating Engine, and in doing so pioneered the concept of real-time rating. EZLynx® Rating Engine still remains the leading real-time solution vendor for independent agents, with more than half of all agencies relying on us to provide more than 5 million home, auto, and package transactions every month in 48 states with 169 insurance companies.

The good news is that we didn't stop there. We created more solutions that tested the boundaries of technology. With our mission to address industry issues in mind, we set out to fully automate the exchange of information between the insurance carrier, independent agent, and end consumer. Today, EZLynx is much more than just a rating company. It has expanded to include solutions that reach every aspect of agency life, including consumer-facing quoting & self-service, customer life-cycle management and retention, automated marketing, and website solutions.

Description

Information Analytics

Job Description

In Aftermarket Analytics, we support services growth by leveraging a data-driven understanding of dealer and customer services behaviors.

The team’s core project – Lens - is a data-driven approach which translates dealer-to-customer aftermarket invoices data (lists of parts) into the actual component and repair which was performed, as well as the most likely piece of equipment which benefited from the repair. This helps to better understand and leverage service (repair/maintenance) customer and dealer behaviors.

The value of this project is determined by its coverage (components and repairs), its quality (accuracy and confidence) and as importantly by its alignment to the services growth agenda. That implies managing a complex network of stakeholders from product groups, component groups, services development teams, distribution (service operations) to sales execution teams and dealerships.

Job Duties

As Aftermarket Data Analyst, you will be a key contributor to Lens and collaborate with data scientists, data engineers and our partners.
