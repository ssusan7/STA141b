Our world relies on AI more and more each day. But what does it actually mean for AI to be 'reliable'? As you consider the question, are you finding that the rabbit hole grows deeper and deeper? Does it intrigue you as both a necessary and valuable question for people to answer? If so, we'd love to meet you.

At Datatron, we create technology to help the growing number of companies sprinting towards reliance on machine learning as part of their operations. Our combination of model ops and governance products ensure machine learning artifacts created by our customers are easy for them to deploy, highly available, and continuously measured for target performance...regardless of how they were developed. We help them guard against bias and drift, safely manage the release of new versions, and alert them to potential issues as they arise.

WE EMBRACE A TALENT-LED CULTURE

Our work is driven by our team’s desire to be pioneers.

In 2009, we created Robots & Pencils with the then-contrarian view that mobile would be more transformative than the Internet. Turns out we were right.

Our approach has been to create a company designed to follow the talent, allowing us to amass an unfair share of hyper-skilled people who call Robots & Pencils home. A team of people who not only develop innovative solutions to transform businesses, but also create products that have been previously inconceivable.

You’re also diligent about meeting allocated budgets and can work within time constraints, but you will never sacrifice quality.

On top of this, you are independent, but you’re also comfortable working in cross-functional teams. You have excellent communications skills and can share insights and expectations with stakeholders, clients, team members and various levels of management.

About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

More About Hopper

Today, Hopper is best known as a travel app. We're going to do about $1B in sales this year and weathered the COVID storm better than anyone expected. We just raised $170M from Goldman Sachs and Capital One, and inked a deal to be the exclusive travel provider for Capital One Travel.

We owe our success, in large part, to a proprietary suite of data-driven and risk-based financial services that we have developed that complement a customer's trip-purchasing experience. One example is Price Freeze, where our customers are able to purchase a financial option in the app to lock in any price that they see, on any item, for as short as 1 hour or as long as 21 days with Hopper taking the risk on the other side of the trade.

Now we're laying the groundwork for continued expansion in 2021 by adding great people to our team who can help us compete with the travel giants."

More About Hopper

Today, Hopper is best known as a travel app. We're going to do about $1B in sales this year and weathered the COVID storm better than anyone expected. We just raised $170M from Goldman Sachs and Capital One, and inked a deal to be the exclusive travel provider for Capital One Travel.

We owe our success, in large part, to a proprietary suite of data-driven and risk-based financial services that we have developed that complement a customer's trip-purchasing experience. One example is Price Freeze, where our customers are able to purchase a financial option in the app to lock in any price that they see, on any item, for as short as 1 hour or as long as 21 days with Hopper taking the risk on the other side of the trade.

Now we're laying the groundwork for continued expansion in 2021 by adding great people to our team who can help us compete with the travel giants.

https://vimeo.com/65768597

The videos above are UK centric, but our current interest is Europe wide. Feel free to research the other markets. This is a longer video that to me explains why there is such large opportunity going forward for the electricity traders who are able to efficiently analyse supply and demand fundamentals and move power between countries, for the benefit of all.

Once Europe is conquered, we do genuinely intend on going global. The American power markets look next on the plate, followed by the Australian and Japanese."

About Capital One Canada

We’ve been helping millions of Canadians for over 20 years by providing them with access to credit. We’re on a journey to put our customers first, and keep them there, by providing innovative, smart solutions that make banking effortless.

Working with us

Capital One Canada is a data-driven tech company that just happens to do credit cards. We focus on customer-first solutions, and we’re united with this common goal. We have all the advantages of a startup, with the resources of a big company. In our dynamic, agile environment, you’ll be encouraged to have ownership over your own work, with ample opportunity for career movement and advancement.

We offer exciting opportunities for innovation as the industry becomes increasingly focused on digital technology, and the amount of data available to ground our strategies continues to grow. With your help, we will build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

Our approach is designed to foster collaboration and innovation with a focus on agility and teamwork. We’re passionate about associates having fun, and since it’s uncomfortable to do any of those things in a suit and tie, those aren’t required either. We have a business casual dress code because we believe our associates will do their best work when they’re feeling like themselves.

It’s like management consulting, but better. (Seriously.)

As a business analyst, you’re not just charged with coming up with great strategies that sound good on paper, but are asked to bring them to life through end-to-end delivery, measuring their impact through testing and monitoring, and ultimately being accountable for both P&L and customer outcomes.

You’ll spend time gathering and visualizing data, storytelling through presentations, collaborating with experts in areas like legal and technology, and influencing senior leadership on critical decisions. You’ll work with tools like SQL to query data, spreadsheets and python-based notebooks to organize it, slides to present it, along with a number of other modern analytics tools. We work in agile, cross-functional teams so you’ll also have the opportunity to learn from other job families like data science and process management too.

We are defining the next generation of banking in Canada, challenging the brick and mortar status quo. We are looking for well-rounded, passionate, and analytical professionals to join our high performing culture focused on customer-centric design and data-driven problem-solving.

As a Senior Business Analyst at Capital One, you will apply your strategic and analytical skills to major company challenges. You will team up with world-class analytics professionals to develop and test strategies that ultimately impact the bottom line. And you will do it all in a collaborative environment that values your insight, encourages you to take on new responsibility, promotes continuous learning, and rewards innovation. We’ll invest in you and give you work you’re excited to do.

We are looking for big picture thinking, analytically minded team players who possess a range of strengths:
Analytically oriented: Experience in analytical problem-solving. Conceptual thinking skills must be complemented by a strong quantitative orientation, given that a large part of the business is based on rigorous analytics. Are comfortable writing basic code in languages like SQL or Python, and interested in growing this skill.
Strategically minded: A thoughtful decision maker who is able to bring actionable and grounded recommendations to senior leadership. Able to identify and synthesize business challenges and opportunities, and solve for them using analysis to make strategic or tactical recommendations.
Influential communicator: Ability to communicate complex ideas both verbally and in writing, coupled with strategic influencing skills and the ability to drive agreement through intellect and interpersonal skills.
Results oriented: Focuses on driving impact both short and long term, and are able to drive and execute an agenda end-to-end from conception through to in-market delivery within an uncertain and fluid environment.
Team player: Helps us achieve more than the sum of our parts by collaborating effectively with others and encouraging an inclusive culture with diverse teammates.

Our business analysts work in a wide range of exciting areas across the business, including:
Product: Perform modeling/analytics to assist new product and pricing strategies for various lending products.
Marketing: Develop direct-to-consumer marketing strategy and initiatives to support business growth objectives. Help build targeted insights to inform the design and development of new customer experiences, as well as breakthrough technology and concepts designed to deliver on new go to market strategies.
Credit Risk: Support step-change improvements in credit performance by connecting drivers of future consumer credit trends to historical behaviour, creating risk models, and testing hypotheses using rigorous monitoring and analysis.

Senior Associate, Business Analyst

About Capital One Canada

We’ve been helping millions of Canadians for over 20 years by providing them with access to credit. We’re on a journey to put our customers first, and keep them there, by providing innovative, smart solutions that make banking effortless.

Working with us

Capital One Canada is a data-driven tech company that just happens to do credit cards. We focus on customer-first solutions, and we’re united with this common goal. We have all the advantages of a startup, with the resources of a big company. In our dynamic, agile environment, you’ll be encouraged to have ownership over your own work, with ample opportunity for career movement and advancement.

We offer exciting opportunities for innovation as the industry becomes increasingly focused on digital technology, and the amount of data available to ground our strategies continues to grow. With your help, we will build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

Our approach is designed to foster collaboration and innovation with a focus on agility and teamwork. We’re passionate about associates having fun, and since it’s uncomfortable to do any of those things in a suit and tie, those aren’t required either. We have a business casual dress code because we believe our associates will do their best work when they’re feeling like themselves.

It’s like management consulting, but better. (Seriously.)

As a business analyst, you’re not just charged with coming up with great strategies that sound good on paper, but are asked to bring them to life through end-to-end delivery, measuring their impact through testing and monitoring, and ultimately being accountable for both P&L and customer outcomes.

You’ll spend time gathering and visualizing data, storytelling through presentations, collaborating with experts in areas like legal and technology, and influencing senior leadership on critical decisions. You’ll work with tools like SQL to query data, spreadsheets and python-based notebooks to organize it, slides to present it, along with a number of other modern analytics tools. We work in agile, cross-functional teams so you’ll also have the opportunity to learn from other job families like data science and process management too.

We are defining the next generation of banking in Canada, challenging the brick and mortar status quo. We are looking for well-rounded, passionate, and analytical professionals to join our high performing culture focused on customer-centric design and data-driven problem-solving.

As a Senior Business Analyst at Capital One, you will apply your strategic and analytical skills to major company challenges. You will team up with world-class analytics professionals to develop and test strategies that ultimately impact the bottom line. And you will do it all in a collaborative environment that values your insight, encourages you to take on new responsibility, promotes continuous learning, and rewards innovation. We’ll invest in you and give you work you’re excited to do.

We are looking for big picture thinking, analytically minded team players who possess a range of strengths:
Analytically oriented: Experience in analytical problem-solving. Conceptual thinking skills must be complemented by a strong quantitative orientation, given that a large part of the business is based on rigorous analytics. Are comfortable writing basic code in languages like SQL or Python, and interested in growing this skill.
Strategically minded: A thoughtful decision maker who is able to bring actionable and grounded recommendations to senior leadership. Able to identify and synthesize business challenges and opportunities, and solve for them using analysis to make strategic or tactical recommendations.
Influential communicator: Ability to communicate complex ideas both verbally and in writing, coupled with strategic influencing skills and the ability to drive agreement through intellect and interpersonal skills.
Results oriented: Focuses on driving impact both short and long term, and are able to drive and execute an agenda end-to-end from conception through to in-market delivery within an uncertain and fluid environment.
Team player: Helps us achieve more than the sum of our parts by collaborating effectively with others and encouraging an inclusive culture with diverse teammates.

Our business analysts work in a wide range of exciting areas across the business, including:
Product: Perform modeling/analytics to assist new product and pricing strategies for various lending products.
Marketing: Develop direct-to-consumer marketing strategy and initiatives to support business growth objectives. Help build targeted insights to inform the design and development of new customer experiences, as well as breakthrough technology and concepts designed to deliver on new go to market strategies.
Credit Risk: Support step-change improvements in credit performance by connecting drivers of future consumer credit trends to historical behaviour, creating risk models, and testing hypotheses using rigorous monitoring and analysis.

About Capital One Canada

We’ve been helping millions of Canadians for over 20 years by providing them with access to credit. We’re on a journey to put our customers first, and keep them there, by providing innovative, smart solutions that make banking effortless.

Working with us

Capital One Canada is a data-driven tech company that just happens to do credit cards. We focus on customer-first solutions, and we’re united with this common goal. We have all the advantages of a startup, with the resources of a big company. In our dynamic, agile environment, you’ll be encouraged to have ownership over your own work, with ample opportunity for career movement and advancement.

We offer exciting opportunities for innovation as the industry becomes increasingly focused on digital technology, and the amount of data available to ground our strategies continues to grow. With your help, we will build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

Our approach is designed to foster collaboration and innovation with a focus on agility and teamwork. We’re passionate about associates having fun, and since it’s uncomfortable to do any of those things in a suit and tie, those aren’t required either. We have a business casual dress code because we believe our associates will do their best work when they’re feeling like themselves.

It’s like management consulting, but better. (Seriously.)

As a business analyst, you’re not just charged with coming up with great strategies that sound good on paper, but are asked to bring them to life through end-to-end delivery, measuring their impact through testing and monitoring, and ultimately being accountable for both P&L and customer outcomes.

You’ll spend time gathering and visualizing data, storytelling through presentations, collaborating with experts in areas like legal and technology, and influencing senior leadership on critical decisions. You’ll work with tools like SQL to query data, spreadsheets and python-based notebooks to organize it, slides to present it, along with a number of other modern analytics tools. We work in agile, cross-functional teams so you’ll also have the opportunity to learn from other job families like data science and process management too.

We are defining the next generation of banking in Canada, challenging the brick and mortar status quo. We are looking for well-rounded, passionate, and analytical professionals to join our high performing culture focused on customer-centric design and data-driven problem-solving.

As a Senior Business Analyst at Capital One, you will apply your strategic and analytical skills to major company challenges. You will team up with world-class analytics professionals to develop and test strategies that ultimately impact the bottom line. And you will do it all in a collaborative environment that values your insight, encourages you to take on new responsibility, promotes continuous learning, and rewards innovation. We’ll invest in you and give you work you’re excited to do.

We are looking for big picture thinking, analytically minded team players who possess a range of strengths:
Analytically oriented: Experience in analytical problem-solving. Conceptual thinking skills must be complemented by a strong quantitative orientation, given that a large part of the business is based on rigorous analytics. Are comfortable writing basic code in languages like SQL or Python, and interested in growing this skill.
Strategically minded: A thoughtful decision maker who is able to bring actionable and grounded recommendations to senior leadership. Able to identify and synthesize business challenges and opportunities, and solve for them using analysis to make strategic or tactical recommendations.
Influential communicator: Ability to communicate complex ideas both verbally and in writing, coupled with strategic influencing skills and the ability to drive agreement through intellect and interpersonal skills.
Results oriented: Focuses on driving impact both short and long term, and are able to drive and execute an agenda end-to-end from conception through to in-market delivery within an uncertain and fluid environment.
Team player: Helps us achieve more than the sum of our parts by collaborating effectively with others and encouraging an inclusive culture with diverse teammates.

Our business analysts work in a wide range of exciting areas across the business, including:
Product: Perform modeling/analytics to assist new product and pricing strategies for various lending products.
Marketing: Develop direct-to-consumer marketing strategy and initiatives to support business growth objectives. Help build targeted insights to inform the design and development of new customer experiences, as well as breakthrough technology and concepts designed to deliver on new go to market strategies.
Credit Risk: Support step-change improvements in credit performance by connecting drivers of future consumer credit trends to historical behaviour, creating risk models, and testing hypotheses using rigorous monitoring and analysis.

More About Hopper

Today, Hopper is best known as a travel app. We're going to do about $1B in sales this year and weathered the COVID storm better than anyone expected. We just raised $170M from Goldman Sachs and Capital One, and inked a deal to be the exclusive travel provider for Capital One Travel.

We owe our success, in large part, to a proprietary suite of data-driven and risk-based financial services that we have developed that complement a customer's trip-purchasing experience. One example is Price Freeze, where our customers are able to purchase a financial option in the app to lock in any price that they see, on any item, for as short as 1 hour or as long as 21 days with Hopper taking the risk on the other side of the trade.

Now we're laying the groundwork for continued expansion in 2021 by adding great people to our team who can help us compete with the travel giants."

More About Hopper

Today, Hopper is best known as a travel app. We're going to do about $1B in sales this year and weathered the COVID storm better than anyone expected. We just raised $170M from Goldman Sachs and Capital One, and inked a deal to be the exclusive travel provider for Capital One Travel.

We owe our success, in large part, to a proprietary suite of data-driven and risk-based financial services that we have developed that complement a customer's trip-purchasing experience. One example is Price Freeze, where our customers are able to purchase a financial option in the app to lock in any price that they see, on any item, for as short as 1 hour or as long as 21 days with Hopper taking the risk on the other side of the trade.

Now we're laying the groundwork for continued expansion in 2021 by adding great people to our team who can help us compete with the travel giants.
